# nyxr-graph-appsync-backend

This project is a backend module for a GraphQL API using AWS AppSync, DynamoDB, and Amplify. It provides a scalable and flexible solution for managing data through GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

## Project Structure

- **amplify/backend/api/graphql**: Contains the GraphQL API configuration and schema for the AppSync service.
- **amplify/backend/auth**: Contains authentication configuration, likely using Amazon Cognito.
- **amplify/backend/storage**: Contains storage configuration, possibly for DynamoDB or S3.
- **src/graphql/mutations**: Contains GraphQL mutation definitions for creating, updating, or deleting data.
- **src/graphql/queries**: Contains GraphQL query definitions for retrieving data.
- **src/graphql/subscriptions**: Contains GraphQL subscription definitions for real-time data updates.
- **src/resolvers**: Contains resolver functions that map GraphQL operations to data sources, such as DynamoDB.
- **src/schema.graphql**: Defines the GraphQL schema, including types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
- **package.json**: Configuration file for npm, listing dependencies and scripts for the project.
- **amplify.yml**: Configuration for the Amplify build and deployment process.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Amplify CLI**: Make sure you have the Amplify CLI installed. If not, you can install it using npm:
   ```
   npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
   ```

2. **Configure Amplify**: Run the following command to configure Amplify with your AWS account:
   ```
   amplify configure
   ```

3. **Initialize Amplify**: Inside the project directory, initialize Amplify:
   ```
   amplify init
   ```

4. **Add API**: To add the GraphQL API, run:
   ```
   amplify add api
   ```

5. **Deploy**: Deploy the backend resources to AWS:
   ```
   amplify push
   ```

## Usage

After deploying, you can interact with the GraphQL API using the endpoint provided by AWS AppSync. You can use tools like Postman or GraphQL Playground to test your queries and mutations.
